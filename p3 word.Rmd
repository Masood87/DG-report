## SECURITY

_**Fear for personal safety.**_ Majority of survey respondents have some level of fear for their safety or that of their family's (68.4% in 1393 through 1396). This fear is explained by factors pertaining to the characteristics of the district the respondents live. Districts with higher cultivation of poppy strongly corresponds with higher level of fear among its inhabitants. Furthermore, higher level of fear is reported by dwellers of districts adjacent to a provincial center, districts where highway crosses, districts with mines and mineral resources, and those districts that have border with another country.
There are also strong predictors of perception of safety in the characteristics of the district governors. Dwellers from districts where their district governors are younger and more educated feel more fear for their personal safety or their families'. Generally, Pashtuns and Tajiks have greater level of fear, while Hazaras feel less fearful for their personal safety. Moreover, areas where district governors are Pashtun report higher level of fear, contrary to the areas where Tajik and Hazara district governors serve. Interestingly, areas where district governors and locals share the same ethnicity report lower level of fear, except for Uzbeks). 

## RULE OF LAW

_**Confidence in judicial system to punish criminals.**_ In the past four years, close to half (49.4%) of Afghans report having little or no confidence in the judicial system to punish criminals. There is not a clear geographic or demographic pattern to the perception of trust in the judicial system. Residents of Samangan and Laghman provinces report highest confidence level (66.5% and 62.5% respectively), while residents of Zabul and Panjshir have the lowest confidence level (40.2% and 41.1% respectively). Age, education and gender of residents are also not predictors of their confidence in the judicial system to punish criminals. Only in terms of ethnicity, on average Pashtuns and Uzbeks have stronger negative perception of the judicial system.

While there is not a clear demographic indicator of ordinary Afghans to predict their views about the judicial system, several characteristics of their district and the district governors can explain this perception. Residents of border districts, districts adjacent to provincial centers, and districts with mines have greater confidence in the judicial system to punish criminals. Interestingly, residents of poppy cultivating districts are not different from the non-cultivating districts. Additionally, district governors who are more educated and non-native to the province of their service appears to be associated with greater confidence in the judicial system in the residents of their district. This relationship albeit strong does not indicate a causal relationship as district governors do not have direct role in justice sector. The native district governors are on average have poorer performance in terms of how the residents of their district express their opinion in the judicial system, particularly if the governors are from Hazara or Tajik ethnic groups. Furthermore, having Tajik and Pashtun district governors, on average, have negative connotation on the residents of the district's confidence in judicial system.

## OPTIMISM

On average, male Afghans and those living in urban areas are more likely to be pessimistic about their country's direction. In terms of ethnicity, Tajiks and Uzbeks are more likely to be pessimistic. Furthermore, residents of districts adjacent to provincial centers, districts bordering a neighboring country, and districts with mineral deposits are more likely to be optimistic about their country. Interestingly, residents of districts with greater opium poppy cultivation are also more optimistic. But residents of more important districts as classified by their grade are less optimist. In terms of the governors, residents of districts with older governors are more optimistic, while districts whose governors are Uzbek are more likely to be pessimistic about the direction of their country.

Overall, Pashtun and Uzbek residents report improved financial situation than previous years. Moreover, residents of more secure districts, districts with land ports, districts adjacent to provincial centers, and districts with mineral deposits report improved financial situation. Also, greater opium poppy cultivation is related to improved financial situation. Rural residents on average report higher probability of reporting that employment opportunity has improved. Hazara and Uzbek respondents also have positive opinion about the employment opportunities too. Additionally, districts with mineral deposits, adjacent to provincial centers, and districts with border and land port with a neighboring country correspond with positive changes in the employment opportunities. District governor characteristics do not predict the employment opportunity.

Overall, Tajik and Uzbek residents report improved access to schools than previous years. Moreover, residents of more secure districts and districts adjacent to provincial centers report improved access to school too, while districts with mineral deposits report worsening access to school. More educated and older district governors also associate with improved access to school in the household.

## PUBLIC SERVICES

According to the latest Survey of the Afghan People, nearly two-third of Afghans (63.0%) report that the government has been successful in improving living condition of the people. However, more than a third (36.2%) think the government was not successful â€œat allâ€? in improving living conditions. While urban residents (64.1%) are less content than rural residents (59.6%), a clear majority of Panjshir and Zabul residents also think the government was not successful in improving living conditions (72.2% and 63.3%, respectively). Conversely, a clear majority of Logar, Farah and Paktika residents think the government has been successful in improving the living conditions (92.8%, 89.0% and 87.5%, respectively).

Investigating the drivers of such perceptions, the links between district and district governors' characteristics are studied. On average, residents of more important districts in terms of grades hold more negative opinion of the government to improve living conditions. Residents adjacent districts to the provincial centers, districts with highway, and districts with better security are more likely to think the government has been successful in improving the living conditions in their area. Furthermore, residents of districts with governors who are from Tajik, Hazara or Uzbek ethnic groups are more likely to think the government has not improved the living conditions of their area district. Particularly, residents of districts with whose governor is native of the province and Tajik hold more negative views.

## GOOD GOVERNANCE

The latest Survey of the Afghan People reveals that more than half (52.2%) of Afghans who had contact with the district governors' office or municipalities have experienced one form of corruption. This was particularly higher among rural population (52.9%) than urban (47.8%). There is greater gap in experience of corruption among the provinces. Majority of Bamyan and Panjshir residents report not facing corruption at the district governors' office or municipality offices (92.9% and 91.1%, respectively), while majority of Wardak and Kunduz residents report experiencing corruption at the district governors' office or municipality offices (79.5% and 71.7%, respectively).

The experience of corruption with the district governors' office or district municipalities has strong association with security situation and other characteristics of the districts. Residents of districts where security is worse, report more corruption instances. Also, residents of districts which have access to highway, districts adjacent to provincial centers, and districts with mineral deposits have experienced higher rate of corruption. Residents of the 8 land port districts are more likely to have experienced corruption too. Interestingly, districts with larger opium poppy cultivation have less experience of corruption.

On average, areas with Uzbek and Hazara population have reported less instances of corruption at district governors' office or district municipalities. Residents of districts with Uzbek governor are also less likely to face corruption. Furthermore, districts where residents and governors are both Tajik have less experience of corruption, while districts where residents and governors are both Pashtun are more likely to experience a form of corruption. Younger district governors are also associated with more experience of corruption on average.

## POPPY CULTIVATION

In 1396 (2017), an estimated 328,000 hectares of land were used to cultivate opium poppy, which is the highest record to this date. The opium poppy is entirely within the shadow economy which does not contribute directly to Afghanistan's economy, and the income from the opium poppy is believed to be a source of financing for the insurgent groups such as the Taliban. Southern region remains the top cultivating regions in the country with 197,207 hectares of land (60% of total), and Helmand province remains the top cultivating province with 144,018 hectares of land (44% of total). The growth in opium poppy cultivation has been so high in Helmand province that the area under cultivation in 1396 (2017) in Helmand was about same as the whole country in 1391 (2012).

Using the Afghan Opium Survey, various district characteristics and district governors' characteristics were tested for association with the quantity of land under opium poppy cultivation. Security seems to have a strong relationship with quantity of opium poppy cultivation, with more insecure districts cultivation more. It appears that economics also correlates with the opium poppy cultivation, as more resourceful districts such as districts bordering a foreign country, particularly districts with ports, and mineral deposits have on average lower level of opium poppy cultivation. However, districts that are considered more important as classified through grades are also more likely to cultivate more land.

Districts with younger district governors appear to correspond with higher level of opium poppy cultivation in those districts. Furthermore, districts with more cultivation have less educated governors. Interestingly, districts with native governors are more likely to cultivate more on average. Also, on average districts with Uzbek governors have lower rate of cultivation.
